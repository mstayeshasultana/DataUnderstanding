# DataUnderstanding

This exercise relates to the data understanding and data preparation stages of the Crisp Data Mining (CRISP-DM) model presented on the course. The questions at this stage of a data-analysis project are for example:

Is the data quality sufficient?
How can we check the data for problems?
How can we clean the data?
How is the data best transformed for modeling?
It may be tempting to just run a model on data without checking it. However, not doing basic checks can ruin your whole analysis and make your results invalid as well as mislead you in further analyses. There is no excuse for not plotting and checking that the data is as we expect and clean. In this exercise we do just that, check the validity of data and familiarize ourselves with a dataset, also discussing preprocessing and multi-dimensional plotting.
